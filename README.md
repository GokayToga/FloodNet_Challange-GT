My take on the FloodNet Challange 2021

CONTENTS

- Data Resizing and Augmentation
  - In this part i first resized the dataset and saved to my local devices or drive
  - Then Augmentation and Transforming the data with one-hot encoding, undersampling and oversampling
    
- Model
  - In this part I implemented 2 different models firstly my own U-net model and secondly PSPNet model implemented using Segmentation models for Tensorflow
  - Also the dataset augmentation is called and set in this part
    
- Training the models
  
- Visualization of Predictions with plots

At total i have implemented 2 models (U-net/PSPNet) and one-hot encoding for data combined with under-sampling and over-sampling both
